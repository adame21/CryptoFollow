                This project was created for practice purposes. <br>
                *You may select up to 5 coins to follow and graph with real time updates. <br>
                *You can click "more info" to recieve the price of a coin in real time. <br>
                *If more than 2 minutes passed since last request it will re-aquire the prices. <br>
                *You can search for a coin on the home page and be redirected to it. <br>
                <br>
                This project uses two APIs to get the information and graph it: <br>
                -CoinGecko API => https://www.coingecko.com/api <br>
                -CryptoCompare API => https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/ <br>
                <br>
                The graph is powered by canvas JS. <br>
                <br>
                All the information is retrieved in real time. <br>
                Goodluck on any future investments!
